## 📜 The Balkan Developer's Creed

**We, the undersigned Balkan developers, hereby declare:**

### Article I: On IDEs
- JetBrains makes great products, but €200/year? That's 67 burek's.
- We'd rather build our own tools than pay subscriptions.
- If we can debug PrestaShop 1.6, we can build an IDE.

### Article II: On Coffee
- Turkish coffee is not optional, it's mandatory.
- Minimum 3 cups per debugging session.
- If your coffee doesn't dissolve spoon, it's too weak.

### Article III: On Legacy Code
- "Don't touch it, it works" is a valid maintenance strategy.
- Every developer has maintained at least one PHP 5.3 project.
- Smarty templates from 2012 haunt our dreams.
- `var_dump()` and `die()` are legitimate debugging tools.

### Article IV: On Client Relations
- "Quick fix" = 3 weeks minimum
- "Just add one button" = rewrite entire frontend
- "Works on my machine" is the Balkan developer's motto
- Friday 5 PM deployments build character

### Article V: On Technology Choices
- PHP chose us, we didn't choose PHP.
- But we're professionals, so we deal with it.
- And sometimes, against all odds, we even like it.

### Article VI: On Open Source
- Knowledge should be free, like rakija at family gatherings.
- We share our code, our struggles, and our solutions.
- Today's helper might be tomorrow's colleague.

## 💪 Why We Built This

**Because:**
1. We're tired of subscription models
2. We can write Rust
3. Spite is a powerful motivator
4. Our babushkas need slippers more than JetBrains needs our money
5. PrestaShop modules won't debug themselves
6. Someone has to maintain Laravel 5.4 projects
7. Symfony's DependencyInjection doesn't explain itself

## 🎯 Our Goals

**Short term:**
- [x] Build a working IDE ✅
- [x] Save €200/year ✅
- [x] Prove we can do it ✅
- [ ] Make it better than PhpStorm (in progress)

**Long term:**
- Take over the world (one PrestaShop module at a time)
- Never pay for IDE again
- Inspire other developers to build their tools
- Buy babushka those slippers

## 🏆 Achievements Unlocked

**We've successfully:**
- ✅ Written 1,673 lines of Rust
- ✅ Created 5 Material Design themes
- ✅ Implemented 50+ file icons
- ✅ Built framework detection (PS/Laravel/Symfony)
- ✅ Avoided paying JetBrains
- ✅ Debugged code while writing code
- ✅ Drank concerning amounts of coffee
- ✅ Proved Balkan developers can do anything

## 🤝 Join Us

**You should use PHP Sunshine if you:**
- Debug PHP for a living
- Hate subscriptions
- Love open source
- Appreciate good coffee
- Have strong opinions about code formatting
- Know what `composer install` anxiety feels like
- Have ever said "it works in staging"
- Believe in the power of community

**You're one of us if:**
- You've debugged PrestaShop at 3 AM
- Laravel migrations give you nightmares
- You've Googled "Symfony" + "wtf" at least once
- Customer says "it's urgent" (it's always urgent)
- Friday deployments are your cardio
- `git push --force` doesn't scare you
- You write code in IDE built by developers who understand your pain

## 🌍 The Balkan Way

**What makes us different:**

1. **Honest about struggle**
   - We don't pretend coding is easy
   - We don't hide our bugs (well, not all of them)
   - We share the pain, we share the solutions

2. **Community first**
   - We help each other
   - Today's junior is tomorrow's senior
   - Knowledge flows freely (like rakija)

3. **Pragmatic solutions**
   - Does it work? Ship it.
   - Is it perfect? Probably not.
   - Will we improve it? Absolutely.

4. **No BS approach**
   - Good code is good code
   - Bad code we fix (eventually)
   - Legacy code we maintain (and complain about)

## 🔮 The Future

**What's next:**
- More features (syntax highlighting, search, etc.)
- Better performance (it's already fast, but faster is better)
- More framework support (Yii, CodeIgniter, your grandma's custom framework)
- LSP integration (because we're not savages)
- Plugin system (let the community build!)

## 📢 Call to Action

**To developers everywhere:**

Stop paying for tools you can build yourself.

Not because commercial tools are bad (they're not),
but because building teaches you more than any tutorial.

**To our fellow Balkan developers:**

We've shown it can be done.
Now let's make it better together.

**To JetBrains:**

We still love PhpStorm (it's amazing).
But €200/year? In the Balkans? That's rent money, friend.

Maybe consider regional pricing? 😉

## 🎊 Closing Words

This isn't just an IDE.

It's proof that developers from "small" countries can build world-class tools.

It's proof that open source works.

It's proof that spite, coffee, and determination can create something beautiful.

**PHP Sunshine is more than code.**

It's a middle finger to subscription models.
It's a love letter to open source.
It's a testament to Balkan resilience.
It's built by developers, for developers.

## 🍻 Cheers!

**From Serbia and Romania, with love:**

- ☕ To coffee that keeps us awake
- 🥃 To rakija that helps us sleep
- 🧅 To burek that fuels our code
- 👵 To babushkas who believe in us
- 💼 To clients who keep us employed
- 🐛 To bugs that keep us humble
- 💻 To code that (usually) works

## ⚔️ The Battle Continues

**Every line of code is a victory.**
**Every bug fixed is a triumph.**
**Every feature shipped is a celebration.**

**And every subscription avoided is money for babushka's slippers.**
